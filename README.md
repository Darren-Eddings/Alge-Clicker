# Alge-Clicker

To run, open a web server and point it to the folder containing both resources as well as the .js and .html files.

Alge-Clicker is a game that students can play to learn algebra in a fun and interactive way.
The player is greeted with a dice and an equation, and they must click on the side of the dice that corresponds with
the value of the current variable they are trying to select. Once all variables have been selected, the program will
tell you whether or not the answer is correct or not.

Currently, there are no further plans for this project, however possible improvements could include a remote server to
make it so that the user could access the game via a URL rather than their own web server.
